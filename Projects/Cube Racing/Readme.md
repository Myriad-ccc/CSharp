# Cube Racing
*visual app*<br>
`could be considered the magnum opus of this repository`

## Features
* Creates a grid using DrawLine to visually separate bounds of different the moving cubes
* Creates a playerSquare class to hold various properties each cube has
* DrawRectangle function uses the bounds of the Rectangle property of each cube to determine where to draw the object
* On start each cube rolls a color and then in the timer every cube separetly rolls a width, height and position increment every 10ms
* Each cube rolls a random innate speed, granting some a constant advantage
* Race ends as soon as the lefthand side of a cube exceeds the finish line by a few pixels AND matches the size requirements

*One of my recent visual projects and first implementations of GDI+ features*
